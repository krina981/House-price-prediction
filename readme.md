# House Price Prediction
## Overview
Welcome to the "House Price Prediction" project! This repository contains Python code and Jupyter notebooks for building a predictive model to estimate house prices based on various features. The project uses a supervised machine learning approach to create a regression model that can predict house prices for new data.

## Problem Statement
The main goal of this project is to develop a robust regression model that can accurately predict house prices given a set of input features. The dataset used for training contains information about various aspects of houses, such as the number of rooms, location, square footage, etc. The model will learn patterns from this data and then be used to predict the prices of houses not seen during training.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of both input features (independent variables) and the corresponding target variable (house prices). Each data instance contains information about a specific house, such as its size, number of bedrooms, neighborhood, etc. The dataset is split into a training set and a test set for model development and evaluation.

## Goals
The main objectives of this project are as follows:

Data Exploration: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and relationships between features and the target variable.
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical features, and perform feature scaling to prepare the dataset for training.
Model Building: Implement a regression algorithm, such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, or Random Forest Regression, to create the predictive model.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the regression model using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) or R-squared.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the model by tuning hyperparameters to improve its predictive accuracy.
Prediction: Use the trained model to predict house prices for new data points.
Project Structure
data/: Contains the dataset files (if not too large) or links to the dataset source.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, model implementation, and evaluation.
src/: Python scripts containing reusable functions for data processing and model implementation.
results/: Saved model, performance metrics, and visualizations.
report/: A detailed report summarizing the model's performance and insights.
## Usage
To run the house price prediction model on the given dataset, you will need Python and the required libraries installed. You can install the necessary libraries using the requirements.txt file:

## bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
After installing the required libraries, you can use the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to explore the data, preprocess it, build the regression model, and evaluate its performance.

## Contributions
Contributions to this project are welcome! If you find any issues, have suggestions for improvements, or want to add new features to the house price prediction model, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
